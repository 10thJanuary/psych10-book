# Thinkstats - a tale of two books

This URL was originally registered by Russ Poldrack to host his book titled "Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century".

It was subsequently brought to his attention that there already existed a book called ["ThinkStats" by Allen Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/). 

In order to prevent confusion between the two books, Dr. Poldrack's book can now be found at [http://statsthinking21.org](http://statsthinking21.org).
